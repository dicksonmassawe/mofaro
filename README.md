# Autonomous Agricultural Robot

This repository contains the ROS 2 code for an autonomous center-articulated robot designed for precision farming. The robot features 4 wheels, each attached to a motor, and is intended for use in orchards and vegetable farms. It operates autonomously, without the need for human control, to perform a variety of agricultural tasks such as spraying fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides, as well as crop phenotyping.

## Features
- Center-Articulated Design: Ensures agility and ease of navigation in complex farm environments, especially orchards and vegetable farms.
- Autonomous Spraying: Capable of performing fertilizer, herbicide, and pesticide spraying without human intervention.
- Crop Phenotyping: Provides analysis of crops to improve decision-making and management practices.
- Farm Suitability: Specifically designed for orchards and vegetable farms but adaptable to other types of agriculture.


## Future Updates
- Crop Health Monitoring**: Planned integration of cameras and sensors to monitor crop health and growth.
- AI Decision Making**: The system will use AI to optimize spraying and phenotyping based on real-time data.
- Data Collection**: Future updates will include data logging for historical analysis and predictive decision-making.
